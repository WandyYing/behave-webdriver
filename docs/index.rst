Welcome to behave-webdriver's documentation!
============================================

behave-webdriver
----------------

behave-webdriver is a step library intended to allow users to easily run [selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium)
webdriver tests with the [behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) BDD testing framework.

Inspired heavily by, and borrows many ideas from, the webdriverio [cucumber-boilerplate](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate) project.
