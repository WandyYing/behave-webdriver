behave-webdriver API Reference
==============================

This reference is meant for those who want to develop upon, extend, or alter the behavior of behave-webdriver. This
will contain information regarding the implementation of various methods. Many aspects of the BehaveDriver class deal
closely with selenium webdriver instances, but this document will refrain from duplicating information that should be
contained in the selenium documentation.

.. warning::

    This is pre-release documentation. Until there is a stable release, expect things to change without notice, including breaking
    changes.
